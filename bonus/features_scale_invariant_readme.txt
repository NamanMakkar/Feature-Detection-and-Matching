The SIFT feature descriptor has been implemented in the features_scale_invariant.py file. It is a scale invariant feature descriptor and achieves an AUC of 0.9858 with Ratio Feature Matcher and an AUC of 0.9841 with SSD Feature Matcher on the Yosemite dataset.
This can be run by selecting 'SIFT' as the feature descriptor on the UI. The same feature descriptor has been used in extracredit.py
