The SIFT feature descriptor has been implemented in the extracredit.py file. It is a scale invariant feature descriptor and achieves an AUC of 0.9858 with Ratio Feature Matcher and an AUC of 0.9841 with SSD Feature Matcher on the Yosemite dataset. 
Giving a significant improvement over MOPS which gives an AUC of 0.9038 with Ratio Feature Matcher and an AUC of 0.7987 with the SSD Feature Matcher as well as the Simple Feature Descriptor which achieves an AUC of 0.9007 with the Ratio Feature Matcher and an AUC of 0.8855 with the SSD Feature Matcher.
This can be run by selecting 'SIFT' as the feature descriptor on the UI. The same feature descriptor has been used in features_scale_invariant.py
